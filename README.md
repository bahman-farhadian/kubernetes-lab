# kubernetes-lab

Build a production-like Kubernetes cluster from scratch for hands-on learning, covering high availability, networking, storage, security, and cluster administration.

## Scope

This repo documents cluster deployment on top of a set of already-provisioned VMs. **VM/host provisioning is out of scope** — bring your own VMs (manual install, Ansible, a cloud provider, or any other method), reachable over SSH with a base OS installed. The node count and roles you need are defined in this documentation.

## Layout

Tables are padded so the columns line up in a text editor and still render as tables. Each procedure step is one short note, then one command block, with a short comment on the command that does the work.

One numbered spine. Circle a profile × scenario in [01-inventory.md](01-inventory.md) and one distro (Debian 13 or Ubuntu 26), then walk 02 → 09. The only branch is inside [05-deploy-kubernetes.md](05-deploy-kubernetes.md) (stacked or external bootstrap). Upgrades are 11, then 12, after the smoke test. GPU adds [14-gpu.md](14-gpu.md) after a healthy Heavy cluster. Site WAN/LAN addresses stay out of this repo — tables use example LAN IPs.

Same palette as everywhere else — see the [color legend](00-overview.md#diagram-color-legend).

## Deployment profiles

Four scenarios on one KVM host (24 threads, 128 GB RAM, three SSDs), never at the same time (they reuse the same IP plan) — see [00-overview.md](00-overview.md#deployment-profiles). The host itself is not redundant: [01-inventory.md](01-inventory.md#kvm-host). Pick the matching VM table in that file. The 32 GB machine is not a deploy target.

| Scenario                | VMs | Guest RAM                                             |
| ----------------------- | --- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stacked**             | 11  | 40 vCPU, 118 GB (92% of the host). Deploy this first. |
| **Stacked + GPU**       | 12  | 42 vCPU, 118 GB. [14-gpu.md](14-gpu.md).              |
| **External etcd**       | 13  | 40 vCPU, 122 GB.                                      |
| **External etcd + GPU** | 14  | 42 vCPU, 126 GB. 2 GB stays with the host.            |

Each row is under 128 GB. They are not added together. vCPU, disk, and the per-VM sizes are in [01-inventory.md](01-inventory.md#vm-resources).

## Rollout plan

1. **Stacked — current task.** On **Debian 13 first**, walk 02 → 09, then [11-update-kubernetes.md](11-update-kubernetes.md), then [12-update-ceph.md](12-update-ceph.md). Ubuntu 26 is the same path later, not at the same time.
2. **External etcd** — same spine, the other bootstrap section in [05-deploy-kubernetes.md](05-deploy-kubernetes.md), after the stacked cluster has been removed.

Record the exact pinned component versions used on each run in [15-deployment-log.md](15-deployment-log.md).

## Scenarios

Two control-plane/etcd topologies — trade-offs in [00-overview.md](00-overview.md#scenarios):

- **Stacked etcd:** 3 control-plane nodes, etcd co-located on each. Bootstrap section in [05-deploy-kubernetes.md](05-deploy-kubernetes.md).
- **External etcd:** 2 control-plane nodes + 3 dedicated etcd nodes. The other bootstrap section in the same file.

## Status

02–09, 11, and 12 have runnable procedure (commands, configs, pinned-version installs). [10-security.md](10-security.md) and [13-troubleshooting.md](13-troubleshooting.md) stay outlines until a real run fills them in. [14-gpu.md](14-gpu.md) is an outline pending the first GPU run. Versions marked "verify current" are not promises — check them against upstream before running.
