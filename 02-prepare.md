# 02. Prepare the VMs

**Goal:** Confirm every VM is in the expected starting state before any cluster-building step begins.

> Continues from the root docs — read [00-overview.md](00-overview.md) through [01-inventory.md](01-inventory.md) first if you haven't. Circle **one** profile × scenario in [01-inventory.md](01-inventory.md) **and one distro** (Debian 13 or Ubuntu 26). That table is the node list for every later step. Do not mix distros in one cluster.

## Covers
- Base OS: **Debian 13 ("Trixie")** *or* **Ubuntu 26 ("Resolute Raccoon")**, minimal install, fully updated (`apt update && apt full-upgrade`) before you start
- Every VM reachable by hostname/IP from your workstation (or via the bastion as a jump host) over SSH, key-based auth, with a `sudo`-capable non-root user — including `k8s-fw-1` / `k8s-fw-2`
- `curl`, `gnupg`, `ca-certificates` present (needed to add the Kubernetes/Ceph/Grafana apt repos in later steps)
- The LAN plan in the table you circled matches what's assigned (including firewall LAN IPs, `k8s-etcd-*` if external, `k8s-work-4` if GPU). WAN addresses on the firewalls are site-local and stay out of this repo. There is no `k8s-monitor` VM.
- Each firewall VM has two NICs (WAN + LAN)
- A working path to the internet **once the firewall pair is up** (step 06); before that, you may need a temporary default route to finish `apt` on the firewalls themselves

## Verify before continuing
```sh
# from the workstation, once per node
ssh <user>@<node-ip> 'grep -E "^(ID|VERSION_ID)=" /etc/os-release; sudo -n true && echo "sudo OK"'  # distro and passwordless sudo
ssh <user>@<node-ip> 'cat /sys/class/dmi/id/product_uuid; cat /etc/machine-id'                      # kubeadm rejects duplicates
```
Confirm `ID=debian` and `VERSION_ID="13"`, **or** `ID=ubuntu` and `VERSION_ID="26.04"` / `"26.10"` (whichever Ubuntu 26 ships as), and `sudo` works, for every node in that table.

`product_uuid` and `/etc/machine-id` must be different on every VM. kubeadm uses them to identify nodes and refuses the install when two match ([install-kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/#verify-mac-address)). A from-scratch install already has unique values. A clone does not: `sudo rm -f /etc/machine-id && sudo systemd-machine-id-setup`, and set a new SMBIOS UUID in the hypervisor before boot.

## OS baseline

**Goal:** Bring every VM to a common, Kubernetes-ready OS state.

## Applies to
Every node in the inventory table you circled in [01-inventory.md](01-inventory.md).

## Steps

**1. Hostname and `/etc/hosts`** — one inventory name per VM. The hosts block is the same on every node. Read both first. `hostnamectl` writes `/etc/hostname`. The resolver reads `/etc/hosts`. Skip the append if the grep already shows this scenario's names.
```sh
hostname
grep -n -E 'k8s-|10\.0\.1\.' /etc/hosts || true          # read before writing
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname k8s-ctrl-1                # this VM's name from the inventory table
hostnamectl --static                                    # must match that name
```
Run **one** append below, on every node. Stacked uses the first block. External etcd uses the second. These are the **example** LAN addresses from [01-inventory.md](01-inventory.md) — substitute yours if they differ. Do not add WAN addresses here. GPU: after the append, add `10.0.1.24  k8s-work-4` to the same file and run `getent hosts k8s-work-4`.

Stacked etcd:
```sh
sudo tee -a /etc/hosts <<'EOF'
10.0.1.1    k8s-fw-1
10.0.1.2    k8s-fw-2
10.0.1.8    k8s-lb-1
10.0.1.9    k8s-lb-2
10.0.1.254  k8s-fw-vip
10.0.1.10   k8s-apiserver
10.0.1.11   k8s-bastion
10.0.1.12   k8s-ctrl-1
10.0.1.13   k8s-ctrl-2
10.0.1.14   k8s-ctrl-3
10.0.1.21   k8s-work-1
10.0.1.22   k8s-work-2
10.0.1.23   k8s-work-3
EOF
getent hosts k8s-fw-vip k8s-apiserver                   # the file answers; no extra reload
```

External etcd (no `k8s-ctrl-3`; dedicated etcd instead):
```sh
sudo tee -a /etc/hosts <<'EOF'
10.0.1.1    k8s-fw-1
10.0.1.2    k8s-fw-2
10.0.1.8    k8s-lb-1
10.0.1.9    k8s-lb-2
10.0.1.254  k8s-fw-vip
10.0.1.10   k8s-apiserver
10.0.1.11   k8s-bastion
10.0.1.12   k8s-ctrl-1
10.0.1.13   k8s-ctrl-2
10.0.1.15   k8s-etcd-1
10.0.1.16   k8s-etcd-2
10.0.1.17   k8s-etcd-3
10.0.1.21   k8s-work-1
10.0.1.22   k8s-work-2
10.0.1.23   k8s-work-3
EOF
getent hosts k8s-fw-vip k8s-apiserver k8s-etcd-1
```

There is no `k8s-monitor` VM. Prometheus/Grafana and Nexus run on `k8s-bastion`.

**2. Disable swap** — kubeadm will not start while swap is on. Read it first. The file change is what survives reboot. `swapoff` only applies that file to the running system.
```sh
swapon --show                                          # empty means swap is already off
grep -n swap /etc/fstab                                # the line that comes back at boot
sudo sed -i '/\sswap\s/s/^/#/' /etc/fstab              # persist: comment the swap line
sudo swapoff -a                                        # apply the file to this boot
swapon --show                                          # must stay empty
```

**2b. Leave the install-time default route in place.** Step 6 needs outbound apt, and the LAN VIP (`10.0.1.254`) does not exist until keepalived is up in [03-firewall.md](03-firewall.md). Pointing the default route at it here black-holes that apt run. Step 06 replaces the temporary gateway after the VIP answers.

**3. Kernel modules and sysctl** — control planes and workers only. Skip firewalls, the API proxies, the bastion, and etcd-only nodes. Read the live values, write the boot files, then load those files. Do not use `sysctl -w` or a bare `modprobe` as the change.
```sh
lsmod | grep -E '^(overlay|br_netfilter)' || true
sysctl -n net.ipv4.ip_forward
sysctl -n net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables 2>/dev/null || true   # fails until br_netfilter is loaded
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/k8s.conf                  # loaded on every boot
overlay
br_netfilter
EOF
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/k8s.conf                        # bridged traffic must pass iptables
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables  = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
net.ipv4.ip_forward                 = 1
EOF
sudo systemctl restart systemd-modules-load.service                # read modules-load.d
sudo sysctl --system                                               # read sysctl.d
sysctl -n net.ipv4.ip_forward                                      # must print 1
lsmod | grep -E '^(overlay|br_netfilter)'
```

**4. Time sync** — both distros already enable `systemd-timesyncd`. Confirm it.
```sh
timedatectl status | grep "synchronized"   # must say yes before certificates are issued
```

**5. Host packet filter** — cluster nodes only. The firewall VMs are [03-firewall.md](03-firewall.md). Read whether a filter is already running. If neither is active, leave it that way. If one is active, allow the LAN from the file that service reads, then reload that service. `nft add` is gone at the next reboot.
```sh
systemctl is-active nftables || true
systemctl is-active ufw || true
sudo nft list ruleset || true                                    # what is loaded now
```
nftables active: read `/etc/nftables.conf`, add the allows there, `sudo nft -c -f /etc/nftables.conf`, then `sudo systemctl restart nftables`. ufw active: `sudo ufw status`, then `sudo ufw allow from 10.0.1.0/24` — that writes `/etc/ufw/user.rules` and ufw loads it. Port list: [01-inventory.md](01-inventory.md).

**6. Base packages** — still on the temporary default route. No cluster packages yet, so nothing to hold.
```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y                              # current OS before any repo is added
sudo apt install -y curl gnupg ca-certificates apt-transport-https       # needed to add signed apt repos later
```
