# 06. Update Kubernetes

**Goal:** Upgrade Kubernetes, Calico, and (external etcd only) the etcd packages, one held component at a time, from the versions deployed in [05-deploy-kubernetes.md](05-deploy-kubernetes.md). Ceph's upgrade is [07-ceph.md](07-ceph.md).

**Rule for every held package** (`containerd`, `kubelet`/`kubeadm`/`kubectl`, `haproxy`, `keepalived`, `etcd-*`, `ceph-*`, `docker-ce` on the bastion, `prometheus-node-exporter`): `sudo apt-mark unhold <pkg>` → drain/cordon if it's a k8s node → `apt install <pkg>=<exact-new-version>` (never a bare `apt install`/`apt upgrade`) → verify healthy → `sudo apt-mark hold <pkg>` again. A package never spends more than the length of one upgrade step unheld.

Compose on the bastion: change the image tag in **that app's** file only (`/opt/nexus/compose.yaml`, `/opt/prometheus/compose.yaml`, or `/opt/grafana/compose.yaml`), then `cd /opt/<app> && sudo docker compose pull && sudo docker compose up -d`. Do not pull without changing the tag.

## Steps — Kubernetes minor upgrade

Deployed in [05-deploy-kubernetes.md](05-deploy-kubernetes.md). Upgrading one minor at a time, in this order: **first control-plane node → remaining control-plane nodes → workers** — never skip a minor, per [kubeadm's version skew policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/kubeadm-upgrade/). External etcd's apiserver is stateless, but `kubeadm upgrade` still walks the same control-plane component set on each node.

**1. Point at the new minor's repo and pick a pinned patch** (on `k8s-ctrl-1` first):
```sh
KUBE_UPGRADE_MINOR=v1.37   # exactly one minor above KUBE_DEPLOY_MINOR — never skip a minor. v1.37 was current stable as of 2026-09; reverify at kubernetes.io/releases since a new minor lands roughly every 4 months
curl -fsSL "https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/${KUBE_UPGRADE_MINOR}/deb/Release.key" \
  | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/${KUBE_UPGRADE_MINOR}/deb/ /" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
sudo apt update
apt-cache madison kubeadm   # 1.37.0 was the only patch out as of 2026-09 (minor just released 2026-08-26)
KUBE_UPGRADE_VERSION="1.37.0-1.1"   # confirm this exact string against the madison output above
```

**2. `k8s-ctrl-1`** — upgrade `kubeadm` first, apply the cluster upgrade, then `kubelet`/`kubectl`:
```sh
sudo apt-mark unhold kubeadm
sudo apt install -y kubeadm=${KUBE_UPGRADE_VERSION}
sudo apt-mark hold kubeadm
sudo kubeadm upgrade plan
sudo kubeadm upgrade apply v${KUBE_UPGRADE_VERSION%%-*}

sudo apt-mark unhold kubelet kubectl
sudo apt install -y kubelet=${KUBE_UPGRADE_VERSION} kubectl=${KUBE_UPGRADE_VERSION}
sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubectl
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart kubelet
```

**3. Remaining control-plane nodes** — stacked: `k8s-ctrl-2` and `k8s-ctrl-3`; external: `k8s-ctrl-2` only. Same repo switch as step 1, then per node:
```sh
sudo apt-mark unhold kubeadm
sudo apt install -y kubeadm=${KUBE_UPGRADE_VERSION}
sudo apt-mark hold kubeadm
sudo kubeadm upgrade node

sudo apt-mark unhold kubelet kubectl
sudo apt install -y kubelet=${KUBE_UPGRADE_VERSION} kubectl=${KUBE_UPGRADE_VERSION}
sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubectl
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart kubelet
```

**4. Each worker** — cordon and drain *first* (unlike control-plane nodes, workers run your actual pods):
```sh
kubectl cordon k8s-work-1
kubectl drain k8s-work-1 --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data

# on k8s-work-1 itself:
sudo apt-mark unhold kubeadm
sudo apt install -y kubeadm=${KUBE_UPGRADE_VERSION}
sudo apt-mark hold kubeadm
sudo kubeadm upgrade node
sudo apt-mark unhold kubelet
sudo apt install -y kubelet=${KUBE_UPGRADE_VERSION}
sudo apt-mark hold kubelet
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart kubelet

kubectl uncordon k8s-work-1
```
Repeat per worker, one at a time — never drain two simultaneously on a 3-node worker pool. GPU: include `k8s-work-4`.

**5. Verify:**
```sh
kubectl get nodes -o wide   # every node on the new version, all Ready
```

## Steps — Calico upgrade

Deployed in [05-deploy-kubernetes.md](05-deploy-kubernetes.md). Operator-based installs upgrade by re-applying a newer operator manifest — you don't re-apply `custom-resources.yaml`, since that could reset your pod-CIDR/config back to its defaults; the operator reconciles the rest on its own.

**1. Check the target release's notes** for anything manual (rare within the same major, but check) at [github.com/projectcalico/calico/releases](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/releases), then apply the new operator manifest:
```sh
CALICO_UPGRADE_VERSION=v3.32.2   # current stable as of 2026-09; reverify at the releases page above
kubectl apply -f "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/${CALICO_UPGRADE_VERSION}/manifests/tigera-operator.yaml"
```

**2. Watch the rollout:**
```sh
kubectl get tigerastatus                  # waits for Available=True again
kubectl get pods -n calico-system -w      # calico-node/typha pods cycling one at a time
```

**3. Verify:**
```sh
kubectl get nodes -o wide   # stay Ready throughout — Calico upgrades shouldn't drop existing pod networking
kubectl get tigerastatus -o yaml | grep -A2 "reason: Success"
```

## Steps — etcd cluster upgrade (external etcd only)

Skip this section for stacked etcd — `kubeadm upgrade` already bumps etcd's static-pod image. External etcd is a plain apt package independent of Kubernetes' own version, so it needs its own upgrade, same "one node at a time, verify quorum" discipline as the Ceph mon upgrade in [07-ceph.md](07-ceph.md).

**1. Pick a new pinned version** (on `k8s-etcd-1`):
```sh
sudo apt update
apt-cache madison etcd-server
ETCD_UPGRADE_VERSION="<version from the list above>"
```

**2. Upgrade one node at a time, verifying quorum before moving to the next:**
```sh
sudo apt-mark unhold etcd-server etcd-client
sudo apt install -y etcd-server=${ETCD_UPGRADE_VERSION} etcd-client=${ETCD_UPGRADE_VERSION}
sudo apt-mark hold etcd-server etcd-client
sudo systemctl restart etcd

etcdctl --endpoints=https://10.0.1.15:2379,https://10.0.1.16:2379,https://10.0.1.17:2379 \
  --cacert=/etc/etcd/pki/ca.pem --cert=/etc/etcd/pki/k8s-etcd-1.pem --key=/etc/etcd/pki/k8s-etcd-1-key.pem \
  endpoint health --cluster
```
Repeat on `k8s-etcd-2`, then `k8s-etcd-3`. A mixed-version quorum mid-rollout is expected and safe.

## Also covers
- etcd backup and restore:
  - **Stacked:** all 3 members live in `/var/lib/etcd` on `k8s-ctrl-1/2/3` — `etcdctl snapshot save` against any member
  - **External:** `etcdctl snapshot save` directly against any `k8s-etcd-*` node (no `kubectl exec`; this etcd is a plain systemd service). Etcd's CA is the one from [05-deploy-kubernetes.md](05-deploy-kubernetes.md) step 2, separate from Kubernetes' PKI
- Adding/removing control-plane, etcd, and worker nodes
- Certificate rotation
