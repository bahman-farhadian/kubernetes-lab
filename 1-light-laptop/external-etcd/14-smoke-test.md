# 14. Smoke & Stress Test

**Goal:** Prove the cluster actually works under load, not just that pods schedule — deploy a small nginx workload plus a scalable Debian `stress-ng` workload, ramp the second one up until the cluster is genuinely using roughly 80% of its worker capacity, watch it hold there via Grafana, then tear everything down cleanly.

Everything here goes in its own namespace so teardown is one command.

## Steps

**1. Create the namespace:**
```sh
kubectl create namespace smoke-test
```

**2. Baseline: read the cluster's real capacity before adding load.** Ceph (mon+mgr+osd) and Calico already consume some of each worker's 4 vCPU / 4 GB — don't assume the raw VM spec is what's available:
```sh
kubectl describe nodes k8s-work-1 k8s-work-2 k8s-work-3 | grep -E "^(Name|.*cpu |.*memory )" -A0
# or, summed across the 3 workers:
kubectl get nodes k8s-work-1 k8s-work-2 k8s-work-3 -o json \
  | jq -r '.items[] | .status.allocatable.cpu + " " + .status.allocatable.memory'
```
Also check what's already requested (Ceph/Calico daemonsets, etc.):
```sh
kubectl describe nodes k8s-work-1 k8s-work-2 k8s-work-3 | grep -A5 "Allocated resources"
```
Write down: total allocatable CPU/memory across the 3 workers, and what's already requested. The gap between "80% of allocatable" and "already requested" is what steps 4–5 need to add — work this out with your own numbers, not the ones below, which are illustrative only:

| | Example (illustrative — use your own numbers) |
|---|---|
| Allocatable, 3 workers combined | 12 vCPU / 12 GB (3 × 4 vCPU/4 GB, minus kubelet/system reserve) |
| Already requested (Ceph + Calico) | ~1.5 vCPU / ~1.5 GB |
| 80% target | 9.6 vCPU / 9.6 GB |
| Additional load to add | ~8.1 vCPU / ~8.1 GB |

**3. Deploy the baseline nginx workload** — small, fixed size, just proving ordinary app deployment + Service + Ingress still works normally under everything else running:
```yaml
# smoketest-nginx.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: smoketest-nginx
  namespace: smoke-test
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels: {app: smoketest-nginx}
  template:
    metadata:
      labels: {app: smoketest-nginx}
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:1.27
          ports: [{containerPort: 80}]
          resources:
            requests: {cpu: "50m", memory: "32Mi"}
            limits: {cpu: "100m", memory: "64Mi"}
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: smoketest-nginx
  namespace: smoke-test
spec:
  selector: {app: smoketest-nginx}
  ports: [{port: 80, targetPort: 80}]
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: smoketest-nginx
  namespace: smoke-test
spec:
  ingressClassName: traefik
  rules:
    - host: smoketest.lab.local
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service: {name: smoketest-nginx, port: {number: 80}}
```
```sh
kubectl apply -f smoketest-nginx.yaml
kubectl -n smoke-test rollout status deployment/smoketest-nginx
```
Verify through the same bastion HAProxy path as [12-ingress.md](12-ingress.md):
```sh
curl -H "Host: smoketest.lab.local" http://10.0.1.11/   # expect the nginx welcome page
```

**4. Deploy the scalable Debian stress workload**, starting at 0 replicas — sizing (`cpu`/`memory` request=limit) matched to `stress-ng`'s flags so requested capacity and actual usage track each other:
```yaml
# smoketest-stress.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: smoketest-stress
  namespace: smoke-test
spec:
  replicas: 0
  selector:
    matchLabels: {app: smoketest-stress}
  template:
    metadata:
      labels: {app: smoketest-stress}
    spec:
      topologySpreadConstraints:
        - maxSkew: 1
          topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
          whenUnsatisfiable: ScheduleAnyway
          labelSelector: {matchLabels: {app: smoketest-stress}}
      containers:
        - name: stress
          image: debian:trixie-slim
          command: ["sh", "-c"]
          args:
            - |
              apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends stress-ng
              exec stress-ng --cpu 1 --cpu-load 90 --vm 1 --vm-bytes 200M --vm-keep --timeout 900s --metrics-brief
          resources:
            requests: {cpu: "500m", memory: "256Mi"}
            limits: {cpu: "500m", memory: "256Mi"}
```
Each replica requests/uses ~0.5 vCPU / 256 Mi. `--timeout 900s` (15 min) is a safety net — if you walk away, load doesn't run forever; re-run `kubectl apply`/bump replicas to keep going past that.
```sh
kubectl apply -f smoketest-stress.yaml
```

**5. Ramp up toward your target** (from step 2's math — for the illustrative numbers above, ~8 vCPU / 500m per pod ≈ 16 replicas), in a few increments rather than one jump, watching between each:
```sh
kubectl -n smoke-test scale deployment/smoketest-stress --replicas=6
sleep 60
kubectl describe nodes k8s-work-1 k8s-work-2 k8s-work-3 | grep -A5 "Allocated resources"
kubectl get pods -n smoke-test -o wide   # confirm spread across all 3 workers, none Pending

kubectl -n smoke-test scale deployment/smoketest-stress --replicas=12
sleep 60
kubectl -n smoke-test scale deployment/smoketest-stress --replicas=16   # or wherever your step-2 math landed
```
Watch actual usage climb on the "Node Exporter Full" Grafana dashboard from [13-observability.md](13-observability.md) — that's real usage, not just requests. If any pod stays `Pending`, `kubectl describe pod` it: you've hit the requested-capacity ceiling before reaching your live-usage target, which is itself a useful data point about how much headroom Ceph/Calico's own requests actually leave.

**6. Hold at ~80% for a few minutes and confirm nothing else broke:**
```sh
sudo ceph -s                              # still HEALTH_OK — storage shouldn't degrade under CPU/mem pressure
kubectl get pods -A | grep -v Running     # nothing unexpectedly Pending/CrashLooping/Evicted
kubectl describe nodes k8s-work-1 k8s-work-2 k8s-work-3 | grep -E "MemoryPressure|DiskPressure|PIDPressure"
curl -H "Host: smoketest.lab.local" http://10.0.1.11/   # nginx still answers under load
```

## Teardown

```sh
kubectl -n smoke-test scale deployment/smoketest-stress --replicas=0   # stop generating load first
kubectl delete namespace smoke-test                                    # then remove everything at once
```
Confirm on Grafana that CPU/memory on all 3 workers drops back to baseline within a minute or two.

## Applies to
Light profile, either etcd scenario.
